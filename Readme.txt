There are 2 functions defined for AES-128
AES_Encryption() used for encrypting the plaintext
AES_Decryption() used for decrypting the encryptedData

Running the Code:

To run the code, store the plaintext in hex format in the plaintext.pt file

Example : 00000000000000000000000000000000

Similarly, store the key in hex format in Key.key file as done above

Result:

Encrypted Data : The encrypted data will be stored in encryptedData.enc file

Decrypted Data : The Decrypted plaintext in hex will be stored in decryptedData.dec file
